# Introduction

The Sustainable Development Goals consist of 17 global objectives with 169 measurable achievements and deadlines established by the UN as a worldwide development agenda for peace and prosperity for humanity and the planet, both now and in the future. Recognizing that poverty remains a challenge in numerous countries around the world, the "elimination of poverty and hunger" by 2030 forms the foundation of the Sustainable Development Agenda. Poverty, which was the primary goal of the MDGs, has once again become the central objective of the SDGs. In addition to the ongoing global issues of poverty and hunger, prioritizing poverty eradication aims to ensure the sustainability of the MDGs' achievements.
The problem of poverty is addressed within a multidimensional framework, involving a comprehensive examination of poverty from various perspectives and considering the multiple factors contributing to poverty. In the Outcome Document titled "Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development," the goal of ending poverty takes center stage among the 17 goals established in the SDGs. The first of these 17 SDGs is "End Poverty in All Its Forms Everywhere." This primary goal serves as a fundamental theme, underpinning various other development goals, such as infrastructure, tourism, food, energy, and more.
In the RPJPN Indonesia 2005-2025, the problem of poverty is viewed within a multidimensional framework. Therefore, poverty is not solely determined by income levels but encompasses various factors, including (i) the vulnerability of individuals or communities to falling into poverty and (ii) the presence or absence of fulfillment of citizens' basic rights, as well as the presence or absence of disparities in the treatment of individuals or groups in living a life with dignity.
Strengthening and enhancing social protection programs are crucial for addressing poverty. These programs increasingly

## Background
The Sustainable Development Goals consist of 17 global objectives with 169 measurable achievements and deadlines established by the UN as a worldwide development agenda for peace and prosperity for humanity and the planet, both now and in the future.

The problem of poverty is addressed within a multidimensional framework, involving a comprehensive examination of poverty from various perspectives and considering the multiple factors contributing to poverty. In the Outcome Document titled "Transforming Our World: The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development," the goal of ending poverty takes center stage among the 17 goals established in the SDGs.


## SDGs in Indonesia
In the 2005-2025 National Long-Term Development Plan (RPJPN), the problem of poverty is viewed within a multidimensional framework. Therefore, poverty is not solely determined by income levels but encompasses various factors, including (i) the vulnerability of individuals or communities to falling into poverty and (ii) the presence or absence of fulfillment of citizens' basic rights, as well as the presence or absence of disparities in the treatment of individuals or groups in living a life with dignity.
## Social Protection

Strengthening and enhancing social protection programs are crucial for addressing poverty. These programs increasingly target impoverished and vulnerable communities to achieve equitable development.
## PURPOSE

The Purpose of establishing “Philanthrop” are as follows:
- Achieving SDGs Goal 1: Eradicating poverty in all its forms.
- Increasing economic equality.
- Reducing poverty.
- Enhancing social integration.
- Reducing social exclusion.
## Research and Big Data

Social protection programs aim to generate income effects that enable low-income groups to improve their consumption and well-being. During the pandemic, budget allocations for social protection were provided to assist lower-middle-income groups affected by the crisis. In 2020, through the national economic recovery program, the government implemented a countercyclical policy by providing fiscal stimulus in the realm of social protection, establishing a safety net for affected households and individuals to prevent them from falling further into poverty.
In 2022, the government will continue to gradually and measurably reform social protection programs. This will be achieved through efforts to synergize, integrate, transform, and expand existing social security programs, alongside the development of additional social security programs. To support these efforts, the government will also continue to enhance the Integrated Social Welfare Data (DTKS).
The utilization of the 2022 Social Protection Budget includes specific targets:

The Social Protection Budget aims to provide community protection, expedite poverty reduction, improve welfare, and support long-term human resource development. The Social Protection Policy for 2022 includes the following:
Continued refinement of the DTKS and its integration with various related data.
Support for Social Security Reform in a gradual and measurable manner.
Support for the Job Loss Insurance Program.
Improvement of the quality of social security program implementation and the development of adaptive social security schemes.
Continuing the Social Security Program through Social Assistance and Subsidies.


## Conclusion

Ending Poverty in All Forms Everywhere Through the Philanthropic Movement. However, there are some challenges, including:
High poverty rates in Indonesia and other developing countries.
Social conflicts in welfare policies.
Unequal distribution of social protection.
Inefficient distribution of social protection programs and benefits.
Mis-targeted distributions.
